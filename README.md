Final

In app.py, I created three different routes. The first was to render the home page, index.html. The second was for the assignments page
and the third was for the classes page.
In index.html, I edited the page title, used the image tags to insert an image, added my bio, and used <a> href to include links for 
the assignments page, classes page, and my favorite website: AllRecipes.
In 1006assignments.html, I used the text tags to add the assignment descriptions as well as my favorite assignment.
In 1006classes.html, I used the table tags to create an HTML table that contains my classes for this semester and some information about
each of them. I used text tags to add a description about my favorite class at the end.
